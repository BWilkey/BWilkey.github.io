      <p>Welcome to my Personal Portfolio website!  My interests are somewhat diverse, but my current focus is on updating my software development skills when I’m not off doing woodworking or home improvement projects.  On this page, I’ve posted some samples of my work.  Please have a look around, and if you feel so inclined, use the links below to drop me a line. Thanks for visiting! -- Brian</p>

      <h2>Full Stack Web Development</h2>
      <p>I started <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org" target="_blank"> FreeCodeCamp </a> in 2016 and really enjoyed the Front End Web Development portion (HTML, CSS, Javascript).  Unfortunately, the rest of their Full Stack curriculum has been "under development" for a very long time.  Their new program is available in <a href="https://beta.freecodecamp.org" target="_blank"> beta </a> version, but has not yet come online.  I took a break from coding to do some renovation and woodworking projects, but have started back into web development.  I am building my Full Stack skills, now focusing on more advanced Javascript plus React.js, AJAX, JSON, and server/database skills.  Below are some examples of the beginner projects I did as part of the FreeCodeCamp program.  I'll post more advanced examples here in the future.</p><br>


      <div id="web_design_examples" class="container">
        <div class="project_tile">
            <h4>FCC: Tribute Page</h4>
            <a href="https://codepen.io/BWilkey/live/QQmQox" target="_blank"><img class="project_thumbnail" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s.cdpn.io/591004/FCC_Tribute_Page.jpg" title="Tribute Page" alt="Screen shot of Tribute Page project from FreeCodeCamp about Mike the Dog"></a>
            <p>- One of the first FreeCodeCamp challenges was to build a basic website that is a tribute to someone.  I was inspired to write mine about the stray pup we took in the year before.  Hence, the Story of Mike was the result.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="project_tile">
          <h4>FCC: Survey Form</h4>
          <a href="https://codepen.io/BWilkey/live/ZJaBJr" target="_blank"><img class="project_thumbnail" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s.cdpn.io/591004/FCC_Survey_Form.jpg" title="Survey Form" alt="Screen shot of Survey Form project from FreeCodeCamp"></a>
          <p>A FreeCodeCamp challenge to build an online survey form.  Basic, but it works.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="project_tile">
          <h4>FCC: Pomodoro Clock</h4>
          <a href="https://codepen.io/BWilkey/live/dXxLdX" target="_blank"><img class="project_thumbnail" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s.cdpn.io/591004/FCC_Pomodoro_Clock.png" title="Survey Form" alt="Screen shot of Survey Form project from FreeCodeCamp"></a>
          <p>This is a simple timer for managing coding activities.  There's a tradition in coding to use a kitchen timer to keep on track doing 25 minutes of coding followed by a 5-minute break.  Apparently, the original timer was shaped like a tomato, and the name "Pomodoro Timer" stuck.  This was a FreeCodeCamp challenge.  I decided to animate the tomato a little bit to make it fun.</p> 
        </div>
        <div class="project_tile">
          <h4>FCC: Quote Machine</h4>
          <a href="https://codepen.io/BWilkey/live/yOweor" target="_blank"><img class="project_thumbnail" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s.cdpn.io/591004/Random_Quote_Machine_Screenshot.png" title="Random Quote Machine" alt="Screen shot from Random Quote Machine project from FreeCodeCamp"></a>
          <p>A FreeCodeCamp quote generator.  Get your wisdom for the day.</p>

          <h4>FCC: Simon Game</h4>
          <a href="https://codepen.io/BWilkey/live/WGAKxr" target="_blank"><img class="project_thumbnail" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s.cdpn.io/591004/FCC_Simon_Game.png" title="Tribute Page" alt="Screen shot of Tribute Page project from FreeCodeCamp about Mike the Dog"></a>
          <p>This FreeCodeCamp project was truly challenging at the time.  Remember this game?  I sure do, and it was a blast to recreate it virtually.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="project_tile">
          <h4>FCC: Wiki Viewer</h4>
          <a href="https://codepen.io/BWilkey/live/GZbjjJ" target="_blank"><img class="project_thumbnail" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s.cdpn.io/591004/FCC_Wiki_Viewer.png" title="Random Quote Machine" alt="Screen shot from Random Quote Machine project from FreeCodeCamp"></a>
          <p>This FreeCodeCamp challenge was designed to teach students how to access data on other sites through APIs (application programming interfaces).  It's not all that practical since you could just go to Wikipedia yourself, but it works.  :)</p>

        <p>We have a family tradition of working with our hands.  I didn't do much until I retired from the Air Force, but since then I have been enjoying making a few items here and there.  I've even dabbled in some concrete work to make the table shown below.</p>

          <h4>Kitchen Island</h4>
          <img class="project_thumbnail" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s.cdpn.io/591004/kitchen_Island.jpg" title="Photo: Custom Made Kitchen Island" alt="Photo of white custom-made kitchen island with black granite top">
          <p>Based on a design/plan I found on Pinterest from <a href="https://cherishedbliss.com/how-to-build-a-diy-kitchen-island/" target="_blank">CherishedBliss</a>, this kitchen island features pull-out double trash bins on the left with a hidden pullout cutting board with a slot to drop right into the bin, the right side features two full-length pull-out shallow tray/shelves, and the center houses four full-length, slow-close, deep drawers.</p>
          </div>
        <div class="project_tile">
          <h4>Cedar Ceiling</h4>
          <a href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s.cdpn.io/591004/Lanai%20Celling.JPG"><img class="project_thumbnail" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s.cdpn.io/591004/Lanai%20Celling.JPG" title="Photo: Custom cedar ceiling" alt="Photo of custom, stained tongue-in-grove ceiling over lanai"></a>
          <p>The ceilings of our front porch and rear lanai were originally finished with interior drywall and texture.  The years since it was built were not kind to these materials.  So I decided to create a warmer look with wood.  I used 4" tongue-in-groove cedar planking stained to a rich dark brown.  I added recessed lighting and installed an awesome 72" ceiling fan.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="project_tile">
          <h4>Bar Stool</h4>
          <img class="project_thumbnail" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s.cdpn.io/591004/Barstool.png" title="Photo: Custom wood bar stool" alt="Photo of custom-made wood bar stool wtih red seat">
          <p>Looking for a simple design and a chance to spend time in the wood shop, I found this design on Pinterest from <a href="http://lazylizonless.blogspot.com/2012/06/barstools.html" target="_blank">Lazy Liz</a>.  I later built a duplicate so we now have a set of two.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="project_tile">
          <h4>Picnic Table</h4>
          <img class="project_thumbnail" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s.cdpn.io/591004/Bar_Height_Picnic_Table.JPG" title="Photo: Bar height picnic table" alt="Photo of bar height picnic table with integrated seats">
          <p>A joint project with my neighbor, this table is based on a photograph I found online.  I used Sketchup to design it, and then my neighbor and I built it from pressure-treated pine. Situated between our two driveways, it's a handy neighborhood meetup location and a great hurricane recovery dinner table.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="project_tile">
          <h4>Concrete-top Table</h4>
          <a href="Concrete_Table.html"><img class="project_thumbnail" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s.cdpn.io/591004/Concrete%20Top%20Table.jpg" title="Photo: Custom concrete table" alt="Photo of custom-made round concrete top table with oak base"></a>
          <p>We saw a concrete-top round table online and loved it, but we didn't want to spend the $3800 they were asking.  So, I did some online research into working with concrete and made this table from scratch.  The top is 49" in diameter. The base is solid white oak.  The whole thing probably weighs 350 pounds!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="project_tile">
            <h4>Cedar Pillar Table</h4>
            <a href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s.cdpn.io/591004/Pillar%20Table.jpg"><img class="project_thumbnail" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s.cdpn.io/591004/Pillar%20Table.jpg" title="Photo: Custom cedar pillar table" alt="Photo of custom, stained tongue-in-grove cedar wrap-around table on lanai pillar"></a>
            <p>This weight-bearing pillar seemed like an obstruction in our backyard oasis until I added this wrap-around table using leftover cedar tongue-in-grove planks from the ceiling project.  It's a perfect place for those summer beverages. At a standard bar height, it's great for standing or sitting in barstools.</p>

          <p>This is a real place!  It's in the mountains of Colorado.  It's absolutely gorgeous, and there are cabins along the lake that are available to rent.  We enjoyed some awesome horseback riding the day I took this photo.  Check out <a href="http://www.coulterlake.com" target="_blank">www.coulterlake.com</a>.</p>

          <p>Mike was "adopted" by our then 9-year-old golden retriever, Max, just months before we moved into our pool home.  Here the two are enjoying a little soak in the spa.  (It wasn't heated up at the time.)</p>
